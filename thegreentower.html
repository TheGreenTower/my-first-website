<h2> In Skies ablaze,a dragon's heart,Daenerys,Daemon's finest art. With silver hair and fiery dream,She soars above,a reigning dream, She soars above, a reigning queen.In battles fierce, her power reigns. Daemon Targaryen,eternal flames</h2>
<p>They face the world with dignity at stake.
With their unyielding spirits,
Against all odds, they would brawl.Our intelligence has brought us this
far,and it's the only thing that can save us. Our future and that
of the planet, is yet to be written.How we act now will determine
the next chapter in thestory of life.But whatever future awaits,
if there's one thing we've learned from this past, it's that life 
has always found its way.</p>
